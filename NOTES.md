# NOTES

Blocker log for klend-indexer. Plan §6 rule: every blocker + fix goes here.
This becomes README material in week 12.

## 2026-07-19 — Day 1

### Stale version pin from a code sample
A scaffold pinned `yellowstone-grpc-client = "10"`; actual latest was **13.2.1**.
Writing that by hand would have produced an API that didn't match any current docs.
**Lesson:** `cargo add`, never hand-copy a version from a code sample.

### client and proto version numbers don't match — and that's correct
`yellowstone-grpc-client 13.2.1` depends on `yellowstone-grpc-proto ^12.5.0`, and 12.5.0
is proto's own latest. The two crates version independently despite shipping from one repo.
Checked because a mismatch would normally mean two copies of the proto crate compiled in,
producing the confusing `expected SubscribeRequest, found SubscribeRequest` class of error.
Not the case here. **Lesson:** verify the dependency edge before assuming a diamond conflict.

### rustls panic: no CryptoProvider  ← the real Day-1 blocker
```
Could not automatically determine the process-level CryptoProvider from Rustls crate features.
```
Panics at first TLS use, *before* any network call — so it looks like an auth/endpoint problem
and is not one. Wasted the first debugging pass looking at the API key.

Diagnosis: rustls 0.23 needs exactly one of `ring` / `aws_lc_rs` enabled and refuses to guess
at zero or two. `cargo tree -i ring` and `cargo tree -i aws-lc-rs` showed **both absent** — the
zero case. Cause: tonic → tokio-rustls depends on rustls with `default-features = false`, which
strips the provider, and `yellowstone-grpc-client` exposes no TLS feature to put one back
(its only features are `account-data-as-bytes` and `test-tools`).

Fix, from our own Cargo.toml:
```bash
cargo add rustls@0.23 --no-default-features --features ring,std,tls12,logging
```
Chose `ring` over `aws_lc_rs`: the latter pulls `aws-lc-sys`, which wants cmake + a C toolchain.
Also added an explicit `rustls::crypto::ring::default_provider().install_default()` at the top of
`main`. Redundant while exactly one feature is on, but if a future dep enables the other backend,
auto-selection silently turns ambiguous again — this keeps that failure at startup, not at first
connection.

**Lesson:** when a panic fires before any I/O, stop debugging the credentials.

### False alarm on the API key
Flagged the stored key as malformed (21 bytes, `ro_K` prefix) against an assumption that Alchemy
keys are 32 alphanumeric chars. Wrong — it authenticated fine. **Lesson:** don't call a credential
malformed without knowing the issuer's actual format.

### Secrets
macOS Keychain + `run.sh`, key injected per-process, never on disk or in history. See SECRETS.md.
Note `HISTCONTROL` was **unset**, so the leading-space history trick was inert — a mitigation that
looked like it worked while doing nothing.

Also fixed `.gitignore`: was `/target` (root-anchored only), so `klend-indexer/target` and any
`.env` at any depth were unignored. Now `target/`, `.env`, `.env.*`, `*.env`, with `!.env.example`.

### Orphaned child process — `cargo run` does not die with its parent
Tried to time-box a run with `perl -e 'alarm N; exec @ARGV' ./run.sh`. The alarm killed
`run.sh` and `cargo`, but `cargo run` execs `target/debug/klend-indexer` as a **child that
survived the parent's death**. Two orphans ran for ~19 and ~9 minutes unnoticed, streaming
billable data, and silently corrupted two measurements — logs kept growing after they were
"stopped", so any rate computed from wall clock was garbage.

Two lessons, both of which matter more later than they did today:
1. **Verify the process is dead, don't assume the timeout killed it.** `ps aux | grep klend-indexer`.
   For real time-boxing use `cargo build` then run the binary directly, or put the child in its
   own process group and kill the group.
2. **Derive elapsed time from the DATA, not the clock.** Slot numbers are a trustworthy clock
   (~400 ms/slot) and are immune to this class of error:
   `(last_slot - first_slot) * 0.4 = seconds`. Any measurement of a stream should be timed by
   the stream itself.

This is a preview of the 24/7 operation problem in §7d — process supervision is a real skill gap,
and it showed up on day 1.

## First stream observations (mainnet)

~1900 updates, 232 unique pubkeys, 206 distinct slots.

| data_len | updates | share | hypothesis |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8624 | 1812 | 95.4% | `Reserve` |
| 3344 | 79 | 4.2% | `Obligation` |
| 4664 | 8 | 0.4% | ? — third account type |
| 1032 | 1 | 0.05% | ? — fourth account type |

**Correction to the first (small, corrupted) sample:** there are at least **four** account
layouts under the klend owner, not two. The two extra are rare enough that a short sample
misses them entirely — a good argument for sampling by slot count rather than seconds.

**`write_version` is load-bearing, not theoretical.** 687 (slot, pubkey) pairs appear MORE THAN
ONCE — i.e. the same account is rewritten several times within a single slot, and this is common
(~36% of updates), not an edge case. The earlier note claiming "no account written twice in one
slot" was an artifact of the tiny sample and is wrong.

Direct consequence for week 2: a `ReplacingMergeTree` keyed on `(pubkey, slot)` alone would
silently keep an arbitrary one of several intra-slot versions. The dedup key **must** be
`(pubkey, slot, write_version)`, and the version column must be `write_version`. This is now
verified against real data rather than assumed from the proto docs.

**The ratio is the finding.** ~98% of the stream is reserve churn (interest accrual + oracle
refresh, every slot), while obligations — what liquidation forensics actually needs — are rare.
Implications:
1. `accounts_data_slice` moves from "nice optimisation" to the primary cost lever: 8624-byte
   payloads dominate the per-TB bill.
2. The memcmp discriminator filter is worth doing sooner than planned — subscribe to obligations
   at full fidelity, reserves at a lower rate.

Size→type mapping is inference from size and update frequency. **Confirm via the Anchor
discriminator (first 8 bytes) on day 3** before relying on it.
